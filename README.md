# Test Project for PullRequest handling in Xcode

This project was created with the Xcode menu command File>New>Project... and then choosing git for version control.
The git was later published to this GitHub.

There is one open PR that has a small change in one file. It can be seen and the diff can be checked here on GitHub.
The same PR can also be seen on Xcode. However when clicking the "show changes" button, nothing happens except a endless activity indicator where the PR diff should be.
